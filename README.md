## Plan on improving the project

The triple espresso website has an issue where the specialty coffee image overlaps the text on the home page when the screen size is changed. This is because the image has a fixed size and does not scale accordingly. To fix this, the image should be set to a percentage-based width or use a CSS media query to adjust its size based on the screen size. Additionally, adding a margin or padding around the image can prevent it from overlapping the text and improve its visual appeal. By implementing these changes, the image will always scale correctly, regardless of the screen size, enhancing the user experience and making the website more visually appealing.

The landing recipes page can be improved by incorporating it as a "slideshow" as scroll ffeature that allows users to scroll through videos of various recipes. Each video could be accompanied by a detailed description that provides additional information. The "slideshow" would be designed with an intuitive interface for easy navigation. These enhancements would create a more engaging and informative experience for users, encouraging them to spend more time on the page and explore the videos.
